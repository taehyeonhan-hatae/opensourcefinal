Project's Requirements

	1. Tasks to be done:

		1) Data Collection
		2) Data Analysis
		3) Uploading to GitHub
		4) Interpretation of Results and Designing Application Direction

	2. Essential Performance Elements:

		1) Grouping data using groupby and performing simple statistical analysis (using at least 3 methods)
		2) Drawing graphs using matplotlib or seaborn (free choice of graph types, at least 2 graphs)
		3) Model training using at least one machine learning technique and calculation of model evaluation metrics (the model does not need to have high performance)
